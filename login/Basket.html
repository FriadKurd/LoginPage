			<p>Beach tennis offers an excellent cardio workout which is highly aerobic but with low impact to the knees and joints due to its practice in the sand.
			Similar to traditional tennis, 
			beach tennis preserves most of the rules and scoring of tennis. 
			The ball cannot touch the ground. As such, the sport is played entirely with volleys.			
			Due to this rule, beach tennis makes for a quick, intense, and exciting game.
			Points start with a serve and end when the ball touches the ground, 
			forcing players to dive to reach difficult plays, similar to volleyball.</p>

			For that first game of basketball in 1891, 
			Naismith used as goals two half-bushel peach baskets, which gave the sport its name. </p>
